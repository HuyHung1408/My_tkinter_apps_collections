# My_tkinter_apps_collections
Many tkinter apps mainly to practice myself with basic OOP, most will find these app useless. Still in WIP

## Tally Counter
To count and some other stuff. I would not recommend enabling the sound which will drastically slow down the app, I may find another solution.

## Mica-Run
A program that mimics Windows Run but is made with Python and a taste of Sun-Valley design.
